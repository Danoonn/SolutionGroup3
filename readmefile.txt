The final solution of our code will possibly give an error about the Visual Studio program that cannot find the image given the image path. To solve this solution, please follow these steps:
1. Open the DslDefinition.dsl file in the DSL which can be found in the solution explorer in Visual Studio.
2. Select the 'LegendShape' geometry shape and it will open the domain properties.
3. Under the 'Resources' category, change the image path to your local path. The Legend.jpg has to be selected in your computer.
4. If the Legend.jpg file cannot be found, the you have to go to your local computer -> users -> username -> source -> repos -> Workshop 8 -> DslPackage -> Resources -> Legend.jpg
5. When selecting the Legend.jpg, your local path have been created and all the errors relating to the image path have been solved.
